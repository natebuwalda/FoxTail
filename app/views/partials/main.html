      <h1>Please excuse the mess!</h1>
      <p>&nbsp; There's still a lot of work to do (contact forms, webstores, so on!), so please be patient, and don't be shy about emailing in if you have interest in any of the products.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp; Welcome to the home of Foxtail Artisanry.&nbsp; Most of the gallery of items shown will list estimated prices, and send you to Etsy pages if I have pieces of that type in stock.&nbsp; Unless otherwise noted, everything in the Gallery can be ordered and made specifically for you, just contact us!</p>
      <p>&nbsp; Currently, jewellery is being offered in copper, bronze, brass, stainless steel, and many colors of anodized aluminium.&nbsp; Silver and gold, as well as anodized niobium and titanium are available by special order.&nbsp; Likewise, other chainmaille weaves and crystals are available by special order.&nbsp; All payments for non-Etsy items will be via Paypal.&nbsp; We will ship out of the US, via flat-rate boxes from USPS.</p>

          <br>Another five weaves have made the way up to site, which I do look forward to seeing in shiny anodized aluminium colors sometime when I have the spare rings or commissions to match up. I'm particularly enjoying Dragonsteps, as it is both enjoyable to look at, as well as a neat feeling texture.</p>

          <br>&nbsp; A lot of work has gone on, over the last two months, getting more of the site working, 'responsive' in images, far more reasonable in image load times, better pictures up, and more items tinkered with. Let's hear it for progress!
          <br>&nbsp; Taking a break from my loong commission of a chainmaille shirt, I whipped up a few things to get out of the rut, including a little bracelet for myself. I hope to get a wee bit better about update notices, even though part of why I held off was a hope that we'd have a different news system in place by now.</p>

          <br>&nbsp; Bit by bit, the website is getting finished, upgraded in places, and closer to ready to 'live' status. Items are getting reshot, and finally.. we have a color example chain. Mind you, dye lots cause differing results, so the colors are faar from garunteed, beyond 'same color type in the piece itself'.</p>

        <p class="p-2 p-3">&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll get the news section replaced with something more 'suited' soon, be it tumbler or facebook interactions, or something matched to the website itself directly.</p>
