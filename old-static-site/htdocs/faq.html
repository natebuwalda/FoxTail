				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Custom Orders</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; When can I expect my custom order?</p>
				<p>&nbsp; Well, all custom orders will likely require an order of rings specifically for them.  All ring orders happen on the first of the month, and can take up to two weeks to arrive.  Then, in most cases, up to two weeks to make the piece.. faster if the workload here is light, slower if we have an unprecedented amount of orders to deal with.  If the latter, there will be notification!  In any case, generally one can expect the custom order to be finished and shipping out by the end of the month after placing the order.
				<br>&nbsp; Please note, pretty much anything in the armour section, or in huge ring counts is exempt from this.  Really intricate, large necklaces as well as chainmaille armour are going to take longer.  This will be discussed beforehand!</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp; Why does it cost to add extra colors to my custom piece?</p>
				<p>&nbsp; Firstly, we set up the prices of the items based on materials needed and payment for the time taken to make it, and as such, we have the prices matched to the amount of colors we expect to purchase.  The reason that extra colors add typically around $5 per color to a piece, is because there's a minimum amount of material we have to order, and if it's not in a commonly desired color, let alone commonly used ring size, it will just sit, and sit.  If we didn't charge for it, someone could theoretically order a piece with 12 extra colors on a $15 bracelet.. and leave us eating the $60 of cost, for materials we may end up never using for another piece.  We're just too small right now to afford that kind of loss, sorry!
				<br>&nbsp; Mind you, if it's just a few rings of a color and we happen to have some in our extra stock, chances are the price will only go up a small amount instead, if at all.. but 'extra stock' isn't something to be relied on.
				<p id="Etsy">&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Etsy</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; Why isn't there anything listed in the Etsy store? / Why isn't (x) listed in the Etsy store?</p>
				<p>&nbsp; We haven't the pre-made items to list on there at the moment, and really prefer to use Etsy specifically for stuff that can be ordered and shipped out in 1-3 days, rather than for things you will need to wait for the custom building of.  As we grow, the Etsy stock will too!</p>
				<p id="Payment">&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Payment</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; How do we pay for things, especially with no webstore up for custom orders?</p>
				<p>&nbsp; We talk via the email to hammer out the details.  As for actually paying, we currently accept funds through paypal, and prefer it as the main way to handle funds.  It protects the customer and us in case of issues, and makes it quite a bit easier to handle funds from other countries and credit cards.  Do <b>NOT</b> send payments as 'gifts', ever, as they will be returned.
				<br>&nbsp; As to if we will handle checks, money orders, or the like.. it's negotiable.  The big problem is that such things can get lost in the mail, take extra time to clear, and don't give protection to the customer.  We really do prefer peace of mind when money is involved!
				<br>&nbsp; We hope, as we grow, to hire someone and integrate a proper webstore into the site, so as to make all of this even easier!
				<br>&nbsp; On a related note, at shows and conventions and the like, we handle cash and credit card transactions on the spot, so you should be good to go if you catch us in person no matter how you want to pay!</p>
				<p id="Shipping">&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1 class="heading" id="Shipping">Shipping</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; Shipping will be paid by the customer, on top of item price, because we do not want to price the items as if everyone lived in just one place and tack the shipping into that, and then chant, 'Look, free shipping!'.  That's deceptive, rude, and we just do not like that.
				<br>&nbsp; Currently, we only have the flat rate prices for USPS, even though we vastly prefer to ship via UPS, due to better reliability.  (At least in our experiance!)</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - US Domestic - Small Flat Rate Box - $6
				<br>This box will likely fit just about any order of jewelry, unless one buys really large amounts, which we would love.  If you check the USPS and come up with $5.80, scratching your heads about the price difference, the extra bit goes into the padding material.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - US Domestic - Medium Flat Rate Box - $13
				<br>Short of a chainmail armor, we're unlikely to need a box bigger than this to send out an order.
				<p>&nbsp; We <I>had</I> plans for International stuff.. until we found out the bag of worms it is trying to deal with USPS for even getting information about ship to other countries.  Then Duty, VAT, and other such hassles.  We're looking in to how we can get a reasonable and stable shipping cost now.  For reference below, the flat rate box costs.  These are the absolute <b>minimum</b> costs for shipping, assuming we don't hit Duty or VAT or insuring or anything else.. and as such, are unlikely to be the real ship cost. 
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - Canada - Small Flat Rate Box - $20
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - Canada - Medium Flat Rate Box - $41
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - Other Countries - Small Flat Rate Box - $25
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USPS - Other Countries - Medium Flat Rate Box - $60
				<p>&nbsp; We're currently looking into if UPS offers flat rate shipping boxes, and for how much if they do!</p>
				<p id="ReturnsAndRepairs">&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1 class="heading" id="ReturnsAndRepairs">Returns and Repairs</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; Repair Policy</p>
				<p>&nbsp; As it stands, if you damage the chainmaille itself, we can repair many things.. but we do -not- garuntee a free repair.  We simply cannot afford to, at this stage.
				<br>&nbsp; If it's something simple, for example, you managed to mash, mangle, and then finally lose a ring off a hackeysack, and need it closed up again, and we happen to have the right ring size to spare and spare fill?  Sure, we'll do that for free, though you'll have to pay the shipping costs.
				<br>&nbsp; If you bend a few rings out of shape in a bracelet, and again, we've got the rings in the right size and color to spare.. Sure, we'll do that for free too, but again.. we won't cover the shipping.
				<br>&nbsp; However, if you scratched up fifty rings worth of material across a bracelet, or gouged the finish off your armor in many places, or want us to repair costume grade armor that you beat to pieces with a stick or worse.. That will require payment for our time and for materials, in addition to the shipping cost.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp; Return Policy</p>
				<p>&nbsp; The short answer? 'We deal with this purely case by case, and do not have a standard answer beyond, 'We will try to make any problems right.'
				<br>&nbsp; The long answer? &nbsp; We currently photograph all items before they're shipped out (or in the case of locals, handed off), as it helps us to find any defects we may have missed during building or handling.  Everyone makes mistakes, after all, though we try quite hard to correct the few we do.  Said photographing helps verify where fault may lie.. with us, or with the shipping company.
				<br>&nbsp; Regardless, if an item is received with still open links, badly distorted links, or bad scratches in the finish of anodized aluminium, things of that like, then we'll try to take care of it as best as we can.  Issues will have to be handled on a case by case basis, but we will try our best to make it right!
				<br>&nbsp; However, one thing is -not- a return quality.. and that's to do with ring smoothness.  We do not claim to have perfectly smooth rings, for we do not spend time filing, buffing, and working every single ring of the tens of thousands we deal with.  Even with a saw cut ring, the closures won't always be absolutely hair-fine together and perfect, and as such, some rings can be very lightly scratchy, or catch on hair.  We do our best to make sure every single closure is as flush as we can make it, but there's still limits.  Now, if you have doubt on if something is improperly closed.. photo it, show us.. and we may go 'That's a defect, send it in, we'll fix it up!', it's the only way to be sure.
				<br>&nbsp; Please note this goes double for anything with any item using machine cut rings.  Saw cut is meant for jewellery grade work, whereas machine cut will quite often have tiny burs, not-quite-perfect closures, and so on.  That's why we use it almost exclusively for armour (meant to be worn over cloth), hackeysacks (which are going to be kicked around, not worn against the skin!), keychains, and the like.</p>
