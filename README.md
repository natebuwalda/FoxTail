Misc Notes
	http://flexslider.woothemes.com/index.html
		I think I've just found the exact slider/carousel I need, both for product page thumbnail->large picture set, as well as main page carousel for showing off items.
		http://flexslider.woothemes.com/thumbnail-controlnav.html - Product Page version .. and maybe main page as well!
	Other image carousel stuff I've found all around..  Just not as good.

		Spot I got the flexslider link! - http://code-tricks.com/top-10-responsive-image-sliders-to-fit-in-all-the-devices/
	
Main Page (.\index.html)
	Either..
		Need to remove the big gap between top of page and image carousel.
		Need to center the image carousel, instead of left justification as it currently is.
	Or..
		Replace with an actually responsive image carousel.  Flexslider?
		
	Would very much like to see if ' https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/ ' can be plugged in where the News is, as that would solidly deal with the news.  One problem noted is that it likely will not be a 'responsive' object, and we've already got some ugliness from the image carousel for that.  Problem two is 'It just won't work' however I've tried it.  Start with the default page url in it, as I have no pages with appropriate material filled for testing currently, and it's easy enough to change.
Product Pages
	If you've looked at .\products\Bag-Medium.html, you've seen there's a serious need for a thumbnailed display.  A layout like your original image carousel that is currently disabled in the .\index.html, without the image's switching on a rotation, would probably be the best solution.. as well as me switching from highest quality PNG's down to something yielding more sane file sizes. ^_^  Result would need to be responsive though.  - I suggest flexslider again here?
